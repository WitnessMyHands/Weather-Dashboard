## Weather API

The interface is simple with a left-justified search box enabling users to "Search for a City". This feature pulls from the OpenWeather API displaying real time Location, Time, Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed and U.V. Index, in addition to the color coordinated icon imagery of the weather over an entire row.

The five day forecast is displayed below the "featured" city and day under a light-colored background with pertinent daily information.
